# DeFund DAO V3
DeFund is a democratic VC fund that invests in blockchain based companies by purchasing participations in their business using assets provided by its investors.

DeFund has not been created just to give its investors the opportunity to make money. Its vision is to deeply change the way we work and interact, giving everyone the chance to shape the company in the way they want.

Each member has the right to directly vote on which assets to buy, how to rebalance the current fund allocation, and how to improve current investment policies, rules, interactions, and functionalities.

Voting is made through the DEVC, an ERC-20 token which fuels all fund’s interactions. The DEVC token can be obtained in four main ways: 
1. Transferred by DeFund to each investor, in proportion to the amount invested in the initial fundraising period;
2. Issued as remuneration for staking the DEVC token
3. Gained as a compensation for the activities performed for DeFund; or 
4. It can be simply buyed on the market after the fundraising period.
Only members with a DeFund Pass NFT can participate in the voting sessions. The vote weight of each member is calculated over the DEVC token current supply and it’s adjusted whenever new tokens are minted or burned.

DeFund tries to simplify the investment process by using tools like Tally (for proposals and voting) and Discord (communication) through which all members can interact with each other, monitor their investments, and oversee the fund's current status.

Every single investment is proposed and voted by the DeFund members. No allocation or investment decision can be made without the 10% minimum consensus. All investment proposals are presented by the members directly on Tally, and can be voted by everyone owning the DeFund Pass NFT.

DeFund is and will always be public, democratic, and open to any kind of member. No restrictions of any kind will be ever applied except for the ones voted by its own members and compliant with the Inviolable Principles. 

DeFund is a DAO, meaning that all rules governing the fund are written as a code, stored in Smart Contracts, and no individual can ever change them by any means. The only way to make changes and improvements is through creating, voting, and implementing new proposals.
