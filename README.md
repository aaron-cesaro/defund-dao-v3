# DeFund DAO
*Version 0.0.5*

## Introduction
DeFund is a democratic VC fund that invests in blockchain based companies by purchasing participations in their business using assets provided by its investors.

DeFund has not been created just to give its investors the opportunity to make money. Its vision is to deeply change the way we work and interact, giving everyone the chance to shape the company in the way she/he wants.

Each member has the right to directly vote on which assets to buy, how to rebalance the current fund allocation, and how to improve current investment policies, rules, interactions, and functionalities.

Voting is made through the DEVC, an ERC-20 token which fuels all fund’s interactions. The DEVC token can be obtained in four main ways: 
1. Transferred by DeFund to each investor, in proportion to the amount invested in the initial fundraising period;
2. Issued as remuneration for staking the DEVC token
3. Gained as a compensation for the activities performed for DeFund; or 
4. It can be simply buyed on the market after the fundraising period.

Only members with a DeFund Pass NFT can participate in the voting sessions. The vote weight of each member is calculated over the DEVC token current supply and it’s adjusted whenever new tokens are minted or burned.

DeFund tries to simplify the investment process by defining specific proposal types and templates, and by using tools like Tally (for proposals and voting) and Discord (communication) through which all members can interact with each other, monitor their investments, and oversee the fund's current status.

Every single investment is proposed and voted by the DeFund members. No allocation or investment decision can be made without the 10% minimum consensus. All investment proposals are presented by the members directly on Tally, and can be voted by everyone owning the DeFund Pass NFT.

DeFund is and will always be public, democratic, and open to any kind of member. No restrictions of any kind will be ever applied except for the ones voted by its own members and compliant with the Inviolable Principles. 

DeFund is a DAO, meaning that all rules governing the fund are written as a code, stored in Smart Contracts, and no individual can ever change them by any means. The only way to make changes and improvements is through creating, voting, and implementing new proposals.

## Inviolable Principles
The Inviolable Principles are the moral and cultural foundation of DeFund. They're accepted by all DeFund’s members and they cannot be changed in any way. 

The Inviolable Principles are the following:

* DeFund cannot invest in projects related to humans and organs trafficking, arms dealing, drugs dealing, prostitution exploitation, child pornography and other activities contrary to public order, security and human dignity.
* No one can own more than 0.25% of the total voting rights.
* DeFund can be dissolved at any time by a majority of 51% of the members only.
* DeFund must pay a minimum 5% annual fee to the Leagues.
* Whoever performs criminal acts against other DeFund’s members or through DeFund must be irrevocably excluded from DeFund itself.


## Structure
DeFund it’s divided into four main components that interact with each other:

* Treasury;
* Leagues;
* Proposals; and
* Operators.

Each component is represented by one or more Smart Contracts which manage all roles and interactions between the different parts.

To better understand how each part works, and the mechanics governing the interactions between them, we’re going through each component of the following schema

### Treasury
The Treasury is used for paying for expenses, fund new projects, and reward members, Leagues and Operators.

### Leagues
Leagues are the DeFund implementation, monitoring, and regulatory body. Their primary objective is to enforce the fund's rules and implement the approved proposals by ensuring the highest standards in terms of transparency, quality, and verification.

Each League has a specific purpose that is directly related to a single company area.

There are four different types of Leagues: 
* Treasury League;
* Venture League;
* Compliance League; and
* Development League.

#### Development League

### Proposals
Proposals are the enhancements and modifications requested by DeFund's members. 
There are five different types of proposals, each one created with the aim to provide the most appriopriate and clear information about the specific motion:

* Vision Proposals
* Investment Proposals;
* Governance Proposals;
* Community Proposals; and
* Application Proposals.


Each proposal type represents a current state variation request on a specific area.

### Operators
Operators are part of the company workforce. They perform the work needed to maintain and improve DeFund. Operators are actively paid in DEVC tokens for their effort and the work performed is always monitored and organized by the Leagues.
